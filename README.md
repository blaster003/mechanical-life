This game has been put on hold for now, as I keep switching over to new projects for some reason. So now I'm going to work on another similar game, and hopefully I'll continue on this after.

# The-Modding-Tree

An incremental game engine based on The Prestige Tree. It still requires programming knowledge, but it's mostly pretty easy things and copy/pasting.

[Look here for a tutorial on getting started with modding with TMT](docs/tutorials/getting-started.md)

You can look in the [documentation](docs/!general-info.md) for more information on how it all works, or look at the code in layers.js to see what it all looks like.

# mechanical life

This is a mod based on The Modding Tree by Acameda. [This is a link to the game.](https://raw.githack.com/blaster003/mechanical-life/master/index.html)
Basically the goal is to create life made up of a machine (like an AI). This is unfinished and probably won't be for a while so check back for updates!
